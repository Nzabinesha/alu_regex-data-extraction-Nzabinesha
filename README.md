# Regex Data Extraction Project

Welcome to the **Regex Data Extraction** project for ALU's Full Stack Developer program! ðŸŽ‰

## Project Overview

This project uses the power of **Regular Expressions (regex)** in **Python** to extract structured data from large blocks of unstructured text.

The goal is to simulate a system where an **API fetches massive amounts of string data from the web**, by running this script 

###  Extracted Data Types:

This script extracts the following patterns using regex:

-  Email addresses
-  URLs
-  Phone numbers
-  Credit card numbers
- Time (12-hour or 24-hour format)
-  HTML tags
-  Hashtags
-  Currency amounts

---

##  Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Regex Library**: `re` (Python's built-in regex module)

---

##  How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
--- bash
git clone https://github.com/Nzabinesha /alu_regex-data-extraction-Nzabinesha.git
cd alu_regex-data-extraction-Nzabinesha.git
2. Run the Script
./regex_extraction.py
You'll see the extracted emails, URLs, phone numbers, and more printed in your terminal.
