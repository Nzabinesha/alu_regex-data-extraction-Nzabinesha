# Regex Data Extraction Project

Welcome to the **Regex Data Extraction** project for ALU's Full Stack Developer program! 🎉

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project uses the power of **Regular Expressions (regex)** in **Python** to extract structured data from large blocks of unstructured text.

The goal is to simulate a system where an **API fetches massive amounts of string data from the web**, and your script processes that data to extract relevant information.

### 📦 Extracted Data Types:

This script extracts the following patterns using regex:

- ✅ Email addresses
- ✅ URLs
- ✅ Phone numbers
- ✅ Credit card numbers
- (Optional) Time (12-hour or 24-hour format)
- (Optional) HTML tags
- (Optional) Hashtags
- (Optional) Currency amounts

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Regex Library**: `re` (Python’s built-in regex module)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/{YourUsername}/alu_regex-data-extraction-{YourUsername}.git
cd alu_regex-data-extraction-{YourUsername}
2. Run the Script
bash
Copy
Edit
python regex_extraction.py
You’ll see the extracted emails, URLs, phone numbers, and more printed in your terminal.

📁 File Structure

🔧 How It Works
An imaginary API collects messy string data from various online sources.

Your Python script uses Regular Expressions to:

Clean and filter the data

Extract specific patterns (like emails, hashtags, etc.)

This simulates real-world data processing from a web application backend.
